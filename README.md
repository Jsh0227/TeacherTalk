# TeacherTalk

What was your motivation?

Teachers are very underappreciated and stressed.  They find solace in speaking with fellow educators who about theirs struggles.  

TeacherTalk was created as a forum to allow teachers to vent and/or ask questions.  It will encompass sections that will showcase sections called:  Global Teacher(This section will be divided into states and countries), Teacher Swap(Teachers will be allowed to swap unused/gently used items), Glows(Teachers will share their highlights), and Teacher share(Teachers share lessons, worksheets, PPT's etc).  Teachers will also be allowed to comment, like, and share.

Teachers can view the posts but they will need to create a login account to participate.
